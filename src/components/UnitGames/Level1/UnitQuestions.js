        question:
            "Adjust the dimensions (height and width) of the orange container to cover the entire desktop screen (`üñ•Ô∏è`). Experiment with percentage-based units (`%`) and make the orange container fill the entire desktop background.",

            "Dive deeper into sizing units! Embrace the power of `em` units for flexible element sizing.",
        question:
            "Adjust the dimensions of the orange container using `em` units to cover half of the desktop screen (`üñ•Ô∏è`). Experiment with `em` values to achieve a proportional size compared to the viewport.",
